  storyText: 'You rush for the sword and pick it up swiftly. It''s a lot heavier
    than you would have imagined. The raider charges you yelling out a deep battle
    cry. You raise the sword with all your might in an effort to defend yourself.
    The raider sees this and quickly parries your blade before swinging back at you
    and creating a deep gash across your body. You''re not a soldier, what were you
    thinking. The world fades to black.


    Oh dear, you are Dead.'
