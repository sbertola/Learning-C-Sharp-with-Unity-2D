  storyText: 'You grab the shield and hold it up in front of you right as the raider
    takes a swing at you. The shield catches the sword and splinters as it deflects
    the blow. That was close. The raider looks stunned and then winces in pain and
    collapses in front of you. As he falls you see an arrow in his back. You look
    to where the arrow came from and spy a knight. Thank the heavens, the city guard
    is here to save us.
